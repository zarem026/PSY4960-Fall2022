Name: Answer 

1.We've been talking about GitHub and how it relates to R/R Studio. What is your takeaway from today's class?
 
One takeaway that I have is that GitHub has various ways to edit or collaborate on projects. Also, I like it that the owner has to accept changes from the fork for the file to be changed.
 
2. What is one question that you still have ?

When creating a fork on another person's file, would the branch's we make onto that fork stay onto that fork after the fork has been accepted by the owner?
